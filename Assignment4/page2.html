<h3>Willow's Personality</h3>
<p>Willow’s personalityShe is a sassy girl and hates being told what to do. She is basically a cat in a dog’s body. She will always sigh extremely loud, like she has bills to pay but she is lazy and will lay on the couch (we say she is not allowed on) and beside her bed (never on it). She is very competitive and will do whatever it takes to tug of war (including bite ankles). In conclusion she is a menace to society.</p>

  <h3>Willow’s favorite spots in the house:</h3>
  <p>Willow lives the good life and lays around the house about 70% of the day. The top 4 spots are very special to her and she will move between them for hours. Some runner ups include under the table or couch in the basement, in the middle of the kitchen so people will trip on her well cooking, and lastly anywhere there is food.

  <h3>Willow's Weakness</h3>
  <p>Willow’s biggest weakness is food, for example once at the vet she went crazy jumping on the desk because they have treats, the receptionist then told my mum she needed training, little did she know Willow is very well trained and she doggy sports in her spare time. Thus, if you ever want to befriend a Willow, bring her food and she will love you till it is gone. </p>
