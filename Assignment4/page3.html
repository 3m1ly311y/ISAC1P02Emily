  <p>As I first stated on page 1, the reason I made this website is because Willow sat on my laptop and became a huge distraction. So, I believe it is fitting that there is a page dedicated to how she is a distraction.</p>
</div>
<div id="Content3">
  <p>#1 Willow May not be vocal but once she has a squeaky toy she will not be quiet until you play with her. I have tried taking it away but she will find another loud toy somehow.</p>
<p>#2 She doesnâ€™t know what personal space is. She will get up in your face until you give her attention or kick her out. Although, if you kick Willow out she may scratch on your dog until you let her back in. </p>
<p>#3 The dropping her toys down the stairs. Willow has the fear of going downstairs when there is no food involved or she is not going to sleep in the basement. She will drop her toy and start crying and/or staring at you at the top of the stairs until you get it for her.</p>
